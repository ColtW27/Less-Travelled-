### Technologies
#### Less Travelled was built using primarily Javascript and its Libraries.

#### Database
* MangoDB - Modern database using clusters to store data.
#### Backend
* Node.js - non-blocking and highly scaleable runtime environment for JavaScript-based network applications.
#### Framework
* Express.js - minimalistic and flexible Node.js framework.
#### Frontend
* Javascript - Language that allows us to effectively implement Event Driven Programming.
* React - Javascript library that allows our application to update and rerender only the new information, making for a faster application with less frequent server requests and a more fluid user experience.
* Redux - Javascript library that allows the app to contain and manage front end state in a predictable and efficient manner.
#### APIS
* Google Maps API - Interactive and accurate location mapping.
### Features
#### User Authentication
* This allows users to create a profile in order to add attractions to the map and add personal travel stories as 'Talltales'. 
#### Attraction's Index
* Displays a list of attractions in a given location.
#### Attraction Show Pages
* Users can view individual attractions in  closer detail, with larger pictures and a full description of the oddity. Reviews will also be available from this page.
#### Add Attractions
* This allows attractions to be added to the database by users, storing data including the attraction's name, location, rating, and description.
#### Attraction Search/Filter
* The attraction search feature will make filtering attarctions simple. Filters will include location, category, rating, etc. 
#### Reviews
* Users can leave reviews on the attractions, including their favorite aspects and recommendations for visiting and getting the most from the attraction.
